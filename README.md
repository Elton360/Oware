# Oware
Oware-Web-Game
# Oware is a board game of African origin that has been passed down for geerations.
There are various versions of the game, but we will be following the 2-3 version, where you can capture your enemy's 
dots if the current hole has 2-3 dots.
You can also subsequently capture any previous hole adjacents to the one you are collecting, provided they meet the 2-3
condition.


## Installation
Until Full Completion, Oware will remain offline. Feel free to clone this repository and run it on a local machine.
